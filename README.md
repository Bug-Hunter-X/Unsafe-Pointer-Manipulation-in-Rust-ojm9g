This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to unsafe pointer manipulation. The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, where a raw pointer is used to modify a vector's contents directly. This can lead to undefined behavior if not managed properly. The `bugSolution.rs` offers a safe alternative using proper Rust memory management techniques. This example is helpful for understanding how to avoid common pitfalls when working with unsafe code in Rust.  Always prioritize safe memory management practices.
